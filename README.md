## A Level CS Project: Peaceful Pines

This was a game coded entirely in Visual Studio and ![VB.NET](https://img.shields.io/badge/VB.NET-512BD4?style=flat&logo=dotnet&logoColor=white) as part of my A-Level Project Specification.
You may find that the code is slightly overcommented for a project like this.

> I wrote a very large majority of this code within 48 hours across two all nighters right before it was due (I may have had a few Valorant breaks inbetween). Bad idea. Good result (I got an A*)

> Wrote ~2000 lines

One aspect of this project I found enjoyable to implement was having all these different files interact with each other in terms of their functions and data handling. By doing so, two things occurred:
1. I was able to keep my entire game within one clean singular window instead of having multiple windows continuously close and pop up every time something new happened.
2. I did not have to scroll 1000 lines to find a tiny logic or syntax error. I could pinpoint exactly where the issue was.

If I could do this again I would've loved ChatGPT
